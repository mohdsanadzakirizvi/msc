The sedimentary deposit of a turbidity current is called a turbidite.\nThought 3: The searches for Sugar Ray and Against the Current in the context of 1990s mainstream fame did not yield the correct information. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the search terms. I should try searching for Against the Current specifically without mentioning the 1990s to get more relevant results.\n\nAction 3: Search[Against the Current mainstream fame]\nObservation 3: A turbidity current is most typically an underwater current of usually rapidly moving, sediment-laden water moving down a slope. Turbidity currents can also occur in other fluids besides water. In the most typical case of oceanic turbidity currents, sediment laden waters situated over sloping ground will flow down-hill because they have a higher density than the adjacent waters. The driving force behind a turbidity current is gravity acting on the high density of the sediments temporarily suspended within a fluid. These semi-suspended solids make the average density of the sediment bearing water greater than that of the surrounding, undisturbed water. As such currents flow, they often have a \"snow-balling-effect\", as they stir up the ground over which they flow, and gather even more sedimentary particles in their current. Their passage leaves the ground over which they flow scoured and eroded. Once an oceanic turbidity current reaches the calmer waters of the flatter area of the abyssal plain (main oceanic floor), the particles borne by the current settle out of the water column. The sedimentary deposit of a turbidity current is called a turbidite.\nThought 4: There seems to be a mix-up in the search results. The text provided is about turbidity currents, not Against the Current, the American rock band. I should try refining the search to ensure it's about the band's mainstream fame.\n\nAction 4: Search[Against the Current band mainstream success]\nObservation 4: Against Their Will is an American rock/heavy metal band from North Carolina.\nThought 5: The search result for Against Their Will indicates that I might have misspelled the band's name in the previous search. I should correct the spelling and try searching again to find information about mainstream success for Against The Current.\n\nAction 5: Search[Against The Current band mainstream success]\nObservation 5: Against Their Will is an American rock/heavy metal band from North Carolina.\nThought 6: There seems to be another mix-up in the search results. The text provided is about Against Their Will, another American rock/heavy metal band from North Carolina, not Against The Current. I should correct the spelling again and ensure the search is about the correct band.\n\nAction 6: Search[Against The Current mainstream success]\nObservation 6: Matrilineal succession is a form of hereditary succession or other inheritance through which the subject's female relatives are traced back in a matrilineal line.\nThought 7: There seems to be another mix-up in the search results.

I should ensure the search is about the correct band one last time.\n\nAction 7: Search[Against The Current mainstream success]\nObservation 7: Matrilineal succession is a form of hereditary succession or other inheritance through which the subject's female relatives are traced back in a matrilineal line."}

The rank structure of the Bangladesh Army is divided in two main parts: commissioned officers/officers and soldiers, officers have two categories of ranks one is known simply as officers and the other category is generals or general officers, on the other hand soldiers have three categories of ranks.

The rank structure of the Bangladesh Army is divided in two main parts: commissioned officers/officers and soldiers, officers have two categories of ranks one is known simply as officers and the other category is generals or general officers, on the other hand soldiers have three categories of ranks. Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) and NCOs are enlisted personnel, not officers. From the rank of Second Lieutenant to the highest rank of General all are commissioned officers. Commissioned Officers are regarded as 1st class Bangladesh-government officer. Men and women can receive commission from BMA, Bhatiary. 'Sainik' (Bengali: \u09b8\u09c8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995 ) is a Bengali word, it means Soldier in English, the rank \"Sainik\" is equivalent to 'Sepoy' or 'Jawan' of Pakistan Army and Indian Army. From a \"Sainik\" a person is promoted to Lance Corporal, and from this rank he/she gets NCO (Non Commissioned Officer) status. From the rank of 'Warrant Officer' persons are called JCO. From Major-General to General, officers of these rank holders are commonly called 'generals' and Brigadier-generals are known as Brigadiers in contraction, the suffix 'general' was added in 2001. 2nd Lieutenant, Lieutenants and Captains are considered junior officers (not junior commissioned officer). Major and Lieutenant-colonels (commonly called as colonels) are mid-ranking officers. Colonel and above are considered as senior officers. The insignias of Major-general and Lieutenant-general and full-general were changed in 2013, previously Major-General insignia was a pip over a crossed sword and baton and Lieutenant-General was 'shapla' (water lily) over a crossed sword and baton and full-general had a 'shapla' over a pip over crossed sword and baton."}

Beginning in 1963 with the black-and-white \"Hana no Sh\u014dgai\", starring kabuki actor Onoe Shoroku II and Takarazuka star Awashima Chikage, the network has hired a producer, director, writer, music director, and actors for the series. The 45-minute show airs on the NHK General TV network every Sunday at 20:00, with rebroadcasts on Saturdays at 13:05. NHK BS Premium and NHK World Premium broadcasts are also available.\nThought 3: The search provided information about Taiga dramas, but it did not directly answer the question about the birth name of the start of Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth. I need to search for more specific production details or the original source material of the drama.\n\nAction 3: Search[Hwarang drama production details]\nObservation 3: Netflix is an American-based company that offers a service for streaming movies and TV series over the Internet.

The Source is now owned by BCE Inc., which purchased the assets of InterTAN from its parent, American retailer Circuit City, in 2009. The Source is a unit of 4458729 Canada Inc. and is based in Barrie, Ontario.\nThought 5: The search results about The Source electronics retailer are unrelated to the question about the birth name of the start of Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth drama.
