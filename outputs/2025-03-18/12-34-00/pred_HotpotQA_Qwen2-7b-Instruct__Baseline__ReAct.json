Turbidity currents can also occur in other fluids besides water. In the most typical case of oceanic turbidity currents, sediment laden waters situated over sloping ground will flow down-hill because they have a higher density than the adjacent waters. The driving force behind a turbidity current is gravity acting on the high density of the sediments temporarily suspended within a fluid. These semi-suspended solids make the average density of the sediment bearing water greater than that of the surrounding, undisturbed water. As such currents flow, they often have a \"snow-balling-effect\", as they stir up the ground over which they flow, and gather even more sedimentary particles in their current. Their passage leaves the ground over which they flow scoured and eroded.

Although largely unknown outside of Finland, they have established a cult following on the Internet due to the popularity of their Flash music videos. The song \"Floozy With An Uzi\" is taken from the novel \"Vineland\" by Thomas Pynchon.\nThought 6: The search for \"Harrison Ford starred in \"The Lodger\"\" did not provide the answer directly. However, considering the context, it seems there might be a confusion between the band \"Lodger\" and the film \"The Lodger\". Harrison Ford is known for his role in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", but he did not star in the film \"The Lodger\". The film \"The Lodger\" is a 1927 British silent film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and the actor who starred in it was Brian Aherne.\n\nAction 6: Finish[No, Harrison Ford did not star in \"The Lodger\"]"}

After several partnership changes, Kehoe has continued expanding the Yards brand by moving to larger locations and incrementally increasing the overall output capacity. In 2015, Yards was capable of brewing 55,000 barrels. Yards is currently planning yet another expansion, which would almost effectively double their brewing capability, raising the annual production volume to 100,000 barrels.\nThought 4: The search results are still about Yards Brewing Company, not Triangle Brewing Company. I need to search for Triangle Brewing Company directly to find the founder and their background.\n\nAction 4: Search[Triangle Brewing Company founder]\nObservation 4: Yards Brewing Company is a craft brewery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, specializing in ales, particularly those in the English tradition. In 1994 friends Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit established Yards after producing their own homebrews since 1988. Within the first few months, \"the Yards Guys\" were producing one six-keg batch at a time out of their 3.5-barrel brewhouse, and supplying ESA, Entire Porter, and several other cask-conditioned ales to bars. After several partnership changes, Kehoe has continued expanding the Yards brand by moving to larger locations and incrementally increasing the overall output capacity. In 2015, Yards was capable of brewing 55,000 barrels. Yards is currently planning yet another expansion, which would almost effectively double their brewing capability, raising the annual production volume to 100,000 barrels.\nThought 5: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the search process. The search results consistently provided information about Yards Brewing Company, not Triangle Brewing Company. Since the question specifically asks about Triangle Brewing Company, and the search results do not provide the required information, I should conclude that the task cannot be completed with the current approach.\n\nAction 5: Finish[insufficient information]"}

It is one of only three places in the area to be explicitly associated with the ancient Romano-British kingdom of Elmet, the others being Scholes-in-Elmet and Sherburn-in-Elmet. It is part of the civil parish of Barwick in Elmet and Scholes. The name Barwick comes form the Old English for \"barley wick\", and was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Bereuuith\".\nThought 2: The information provided does not directly answer the question about when Leeds stopped being called Elmet. Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England, and it does not have a history of being called Elmet. Elmet was an ancient kingdom in what is now Yorkshire, and Leeds is a modern city that was not part of that ancient kingdom. Therefore, Leeds has never been called Elmet.\n\nAction 2: Finish[Leeds has never been called Elmet, as it is a modern city in Yorkshire that was not part of the ancient kingdom of Elmet.]"}
