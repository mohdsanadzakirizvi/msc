It formed part of and was, on occasions, also incorrectly referred to as the Perth foreshore, or the Perth waterfront. The public space was resumed by the WA state government in April 2012 as part of the Elizabeth Quay redevelopment of the Perth waterfront area.\nThought 4: The search did not provide the size of a nature reserve specifically near Seacroft Esplanade. The information provided is about the Esplanade Reserve, which is a public space and not a nature reserve. I will conclude that the search did not yield the information I was looking for, and I cannot determine the size of a nature reserve south of Seacroft Esplanade with the available data. \n\nAction 3: Finish[insufficient information]"}

He wrote the screenplays for most of the 37 feature films he directed, many of which are today considered classics: \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941), \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948), \"The Asphalt Jungle\" (1950), \"The African Queen\" (1951), \"The Misfits\" (1961), \"Fat City\" (1972) and \"The Man Who Would Be King\" (1975). During his 46-year career, Huston received 15 Oscar nominations, won twice, and directed both his father, Walter Huston, and daughter, Anjelica Huston, to Oscar wins in different films.\nThought 4: I have found that John Huston directed 37 feature films.

The novel was assembled from disparate stories first published in \"Mademoiselle\", \"Sewanee Review\" and \"Partisan Review\". The first chapter is an expanded version of her Master's thesis, \"The Train\", and other chapters are reworked versions of \"The Peeler,\" \"The Heart of the Park\" and \"Enoch and the Gorilla\". The novel concerns a returning World War II veteran who, haunted by a lifelong crisis of faith, resolves to form an anti-religious ministry in an eccentric Southern town.\nThought 2: It seems I made a mistake in my initial thought process.

Hansel and Gretel are a young brother and sister kidnapped by a cannibalistic witch living deep in the forest in a house constructed of cake and confectionery. The two children escape with their lives by outwitting her. The tale has been adapted to various media, most notably the opera \"H\u00e4nsel und Gretel\" (1893) by Engelbert Humperdinck. Under the Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system, \"Hansel and Gretel\" is classified under Class 327.\nThought 7: I have found the information I need. The movie \"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\" (2013) is a loose adaptation of the classic fairy tale, \"Hansel and Gretel\". The film, directed by Tommy Wirkola, is a dark, adult-oriented action horror film. It features the title characters, played by Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton, as adult, skilled hunters of witches. The movie is a modern take on the original story, with a focus on action, violence, and a more mature, R-rated tone. \n\nAction 6: Finish[\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013)\"]"}

Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the constitutionality of several Pennsylvania state statutory provisions regarding abortion was challenged. The Court's plurality opinion reaffirmed the central holding of \"Roe v. Wade\" stating that \"matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" The Court's plurality opinion upheld the constitutional right to have an abortion while altering the standard for analyzing restrictions on that right, crafting the \"undue burden\" standard for abortion restrictions. \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" differs from \"Roe,\" however, because under \"Roe\" the state could not regulate abortions in the first trimester whereas under \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" the state can regulate abortions in the first trimester, or any point before the point of viability, and beyond as long as that regulation does not pose an undue burden on women's fundamental right to an abortion. Applying this new standard of review, the Court upheld four regulations and invalidated the requirement of spousal notification.\nThought 4: I found information on the \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" case, but I did not find a clear mention of a waiver of right to counsel. I will now search for \"Montejo v. Louisiana\" to see if it involves a waiver of right to counsel.\n\nAction 4: Search[Montejo v. Louisiana]\nObservation 4: Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2009), is a 5\u20134 decision by the United States Supreme Court that overruled the Court's decision in \"Michigan v. Jackson\", 475 U.S. 625 (1986) . The case concerned the validity of a defendant's waiver of his right to counsel during a police interrogation. In reversing \"Jackson\", the Court said such a waiver was valid.\nThought 5: I found that \"Montejo v. Louisiana\" involves a waiver of right to counsel. The case is about the validity of a defendant's waiver of his right to counsel during a police interrogation. \n\nAction 5: Finish[Montejo v. Louisiana]"}

Since \"The Inspector Wears Skirts\" and \"The Lieutenant Wears Skirts\" seem to be two different films, and I was not able to find a cast for \"The Lieutenant Wears Skirts\", I will conclude that there is no actor named Samuel in \"The Lieutenant Wears Skirts\" based on the information I have.\n\nAction 3: Finish[There is no actor named Samuel in \"The Inspector Wears Skirts\", and I was not able to find information on the cast of \"The Lieutenant Wears Skirts\".]"}

Players all begin as allies exploring a haunted house filled with dangers, traps, items and omens. As players explore the mansion, new room tiles are chosen at random; accordingly, the game board is different each session. Eventually the \"haunt\" begins, with the nature and plot of this session's ghost story revealed; one player usually \"betrays\" the others and takes the side of the ghosts, monsters, or other enemies, while the remaining players collaborate to defeat them.\nThought 3: Both Villa Paletti and Betrayal at House on the Hill are board games. I can now finish the task.\n\nAction 3: Finish[yes]"}

The information provided does not directly lead to the name of the film. I should search for the 2012 British biographical film that tells the story of the Rochdale Pioneers, as they are an early consumer co-operative. \n\nAction 3: Search[2012 British biographical film about Rochdale Pioneers]\nObservation 3: The Rochdale Pioneers is a British biographical feature film, released in 2012, that tells the story of the foundation of the first successful cooperative retail store by working class members of the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, in 1844. This came at a time of chronic unemployment, poverty, hunger and social inequality, and it was met with prejudice and opposition.\nThought 4: I have found the 2012 British biographical film that tells the story of the Rochdale Pioneers, who were an early consumer co-operative. The film was released in 2012, so the year I am looking for is 1844, when the co-operative was formed.\n\nAction 4: Finish[1844]"}

In 2014 he received a narrow plurality in his race for re-election, but did not attain the 50% threshold mandated by the Vermont Constitution. In such cases the Vermont General Assembly elects the winner. The legislature almost always selects the candidate who received a plurality; this held true, and the General Assembly re-elected Shumlin to a third term by a vote of 110\u201369 in January 2015. In June 2015, Shumlin announced that he would not seek re-election in 2016. He has signed laws on physician-assisted suicide as well as the United States' first genetically modified food labeling requirement during his tenure as governor. He was chair of the Democratic Governors Association during his first two terms.\nThought 6: I have exhausted my search attempts and have not found the specific information I was looking for.

I will start by searching for \"Shawnee Trail\" and \"Great Indian Warpath\" to gather details.\n\nAction 1: Search[Shawnee Trail]\nObservation 1: The Shawnee Trail was the white settlers' name for an American Indian trail in what is now eastern West Virginia, USA. It was a segment (or branch) of the much larger Indian trail network known as the Great Indian Warpath, which stretched from New York to Alabama. The GIW was referred to from this point north as the \"Seneca Trail\". Thus, in pioneer days, the segment known as the Shawnee Trail was often also referred to as the Seneca Trail.\nThought 2: I now know that the Shawnee Trail and the Great Indian Warpath (GIW) are both associated with American Indian trails. The GIW, of which the Shawnee Trail is a segment, stretches from New York to Alabama. This means that the country of origin for both trails is the United States. \n\nAction 2: Search[Great Indian Warpath]\nObservation 2: The Great Indian Warpath (GIW)\u2014also known as the Great Indian War and Trading Path, or the Seneca Trail\u2014was that part of the network of trails in eastern North America developed and used by Native Americans which ran through the Great Appalachian Valley. The system of footpaths (the Warpath branched off in several places onto alternate routes and over time shifted westward in some regions) extended from what is now upper New York state to deep within Alabama. Various Indians traded and made war along the trails, including the Catawba, numerous Algonquian tribes, the Cherokee, and the Iroquois Confederacy. The British traders' name for the route was derived from combining its name among the northeastern Algonquian tribes, \"Mishimayagat\" or \"Great Trail\", with that of the Shawnee and Delaware, \"Athawominee\" or \"Path where they go armed\".\nThought 3: I now have all the information I need. Both the Shawnee Trail and the Great Indian Warpath (GIW) are associated with Native American trails in eastern North America. The GIW, of which the Shawnee Trail is a segment, extends from New York to Alabama. This means that the country of origin for both trails is the United States. \n\nAction 3: Finish[United States]"}
