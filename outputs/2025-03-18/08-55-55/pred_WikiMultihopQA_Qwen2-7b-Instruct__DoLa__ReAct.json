I need to find the place of birth of Promoe.\nAction 2: Search[Place of birth of Promoe]\nObservation 2: The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nThought 3: Based on the information provided, the performer of the song \"Svennebanan\" is Promoe, a Swedish rapper.

He was born in Lubbock, Texas, to a musical family during the Great Depression, and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. His style was influenced by gospel music, country music, and rhythm and blues acts, which he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school. He made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group \"Buddy and Bob\" with his friend Bob Montgomery. In 1955, after opening for Elvis Presley, he decided to pursue a career in music. He opened for Presley three times that year; his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when he opened for Bill Haley & His Comets, he was spotted by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with Decca Records. Holly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by Owen Bradley, who had become famous for producing orchestrated country hits for stars like Patsy Cline. Unhappy with Bradley's musical style and control in the studio, Holly went to producer Norman Petty in Clovis, New Mexico, and recorded a demo of \"That'll Be the Day\", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records, which released it as a single credited to \"The Crickets\", which became the name of Holly's band. In September 1957, as the band toured, \"That'll Be the Day\" topped the US and UK singles charts. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, \"Peggy Sue\".

Apart from being the most prominent minister in the government, he has also been considered to have been its\" de facto\" head. Pombal was notable for his swift and competent leadership in the aftermath of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. He implemented sweeping economic policies in Portugal to regulate commercial activity and standardise quality throughout the country, and was instrumental in weakening the grip of the Inquisition. The term\" Pombaline\" is used to describe not only his tenure, but also the architectural style adopted in Lisbon after the great earthquake. Pombal, who was considered an\" estrangeirado\"( that is, someone who admired, was influenced by or promoted foreign ideas in Portugal), introduced many fundamental administrative, educational, economic, and ecclesiastical reforms justified in the name of\" reason\" and instrumental in advancing secularisation in Portugal. However, historians argue that Pombal's implementation of the ideas of the\" Enlightenment\", while far- reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty. This included the crushing of opposition, the suppression of criticism, print censorship, the furthering of colonial economic exploitation for Portugal's own benefit, and, at a personal level, the consolidation of his own direct and widespread control for his own profit.

He was the father of Stephen of England. Count Stephen was one of the leaders of the First Crusade, leading one of the major armies of the Princes and often writing enthusiastic letters to his wife Adela of Normandy about the crusade's progress. Stephen was the head of the army council at the Crusaders' siege of Nicaea in 1097. He returned home in 1098 during the lengthy siege of Antioch, fleeing the battlefield, without having fulfilled his crusading vow to forge a way to Jerusalem.

The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth.

A promo video for the track was filmed as part of the \"Break Every Rule\" TV special in 1986, in which it was the opening number. It shows Turner performing the song in her dressing room at the club Le Zero in Paris as she is preparing to go on stage.\nThought 2: The performer of the song \"Afterglow (Tina Turner Song)\" is Tina Turner. I need to search for Tina Turner's place of birth.\nAction 2: Search[Tina Turner place of birth]\nObservation 2: The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nThought 3: Tina Turner's place of birth is Nutbush, Tennessee, United States. This is the information I could gather based on the details provided."}

W. Wilson Company of The Bronx, New York, a publisher of reference books, that appears every month except December. \" Current Biography\" contains profiles of people in the news and includes politicians, athletes, businessmen, and entertainers. Published since 1940, the articles are annually collected into bound volumes called Current Biography Yearbook. A December issue of the magazine is not published because the staff works on the final cumulative volume for the year. Articles in the bound volumes correct any mistakes that may have appeared in the magazine and may include additional relevant information about the subject that became available since publication of the original article. The work is a standard reference source in American libraries and the publisher keeps in print the older volumes. Wilson also issues cumulative indexes to the set, and an online version is available as a subscription database. \" Current Biography\" profiles are written by the Wilson Company's in- house staff. They are typically produced by consulting previously published press accounts and occasionally by conducting interviews with the subjects. Running from 2,000 to 5,000 words, articles usually are accompanied by a black- and- white photograph of the subject, a mailing address for the subject, and a short bibliography. Between 15 and 20 profiles are included in each monthly issue. Obituaries are regularly printed of those previously profiled. They briefly summarize the life of the subject and add details occurring subsequent to the original profile. The entire series is available through the company's WilsonWeb on- line service, which many public libraries subscribe to. In 2003, the H.W. Wilson Company began publishing an annual sister volume, Current Biography International Yearbook, which focuses on people living outside the United States. This series was discontinued after publication of the 2007 volume. Articles in\" Current Biography\" are often used and listed as supplemental material in obituaries that appear in major media outlets.\nThought 7: It seems I encountered an issue with the search results, and the information provided does not pertain to the question.

He made his classical and theological studies at Passau, Bavaria, where he was ordained priest, 12 August, 1862. Showing decided aptitude for music, he was given every opportunity for study of the art, and was entrusted with the direction of music in the seminary. From 1867 to 1870 Haberl resided in Rome, where he was active as choirmaster at the German national church, Santa Maria dell' Anima, and also made historical and arch\u00e6ological researches. From 1871 to 1882 he directed the choir at the Ratisbon cathedral, his incumbency forming one of the most brilliant periods in the history of this famous institute. Working for church music reform, in 1874 Haberl founded a famous school for church musicians at Regensburg( Ratisbon). This school began with three professors \u2014 Dr. Haberl, Dr. Jacob, and Canon Haller\u2014and only three pupils, and attracted reform- minded church music programs. Haberl not only secured permanency for the school in the shape of endowment, but he built next to it a church, dedicated to St. Cecilia, where pupils are given opportunities for practising the knowledge they have acquired in theory. He fought for the Editio Medicea against the editions of Solesmes and others. In 1868 Haberl re-edited the Medic\u00e6a version of the Gregorian chant, and the Holy See declared his edition authentic and official for the Catholic Church. This form of the chant has since been superseded by the\" Editio Vaticana.\" With Proske, he was a prime mover in the\" Caecilia Movement,\" and helped to edit the fourth volume of Musica Divina. For thirty years he gathered data and material for a critical edition of the works of Palestrina, completed in 1908 in thirty- three volumes, the first ten of which were prepared by the joint labour of Th. de Witt, J.N.

While developing\" Fast Five\", Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. \" Fast Five\" is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of$ 100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races. \" Fast Five\" was released first in Australia on April 20, 2011, and then in the United States on April 29, 2011. The film achieved financial success, breaking box office records for the highest- grossing April opening weekend and the second- highest spring opening weekend, and surpassing\" Fast& Furious\" to become the highest- grossing film in the franchise. \" Fast Five\" grossed over$ 625 million worldwide, making it number 66 on the all- time worldwide list of highest- grossing films, in unadjusted dollars, and the seventh- highest- grossing film of 2011. \" Fast Five\" received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the combination of comedy and\" action sequences that toy idly with the laws of physics\"; some labeled it the best film in the series. Johnson was singled out for praise in numerous reviews for his performance, with critics calling him\" the best thing, by far, in\" Fast Five and remarking that scenes shared by Johnson and Diesel were often the\" best moments\". Despite the positive response, many were critical of the film's running time, considering it too long, and others criticized the treatment of women, stating\"[ Women] cameo strikingly in buttock form. Others actually have first names.\" South American reviewers were critical of the film's portrayal of Rio de Janeiro as a haven for drug trafficking and corruption, labeling it a\" stereotype\". A sequel,\" Fast& Furious 6\", was released in May 2013 to box office success, surpassing\" Fast Five\" as the highest- grossing film in the franchise.

The movie is a sequel to Lang's silent film\" Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\"( 1922) and features many cast and crew members from Lang's previous films. The film features Rudolf Klein- Rogge as Dr. Mabuse who is in an insane asylum where he is found frantically writing his crime plans. When Mabuse's criminal plans begin to be implemented, Inspector Lohmann( played by Otto Wernicke) tries to find the solution with clues from gangster Thomas Kent( Gustav Diessl), the institutionalized Hofmeister( Karl Meixner) and Professor Baum( Oscar Beregi Sr.) who becomes obsessed with Dr. Mabuse. \" The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\" was based on elements of author Norbert Jacques' unfinished novel\" Mabuse's Colony\". It was Lang's second sound film for Nero- Film and was his final collaboration with his wife and screenwriter Thea von Harbou. To promote the film to a foreign market, a French- language version of the film was made by Lang with the same sets but different actors with the title\" Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse\". According to Siegfried Kracauer, Lang deliberately intended the film to suggest the Mabuse- like qualities of Adolf Hitler, who was on his rise to become Chancellor of Germany while the film was being written. When Hitler came to power, Joseph Goebbels became Minister of Propaganda and banned the film in Germany, suggesting that the film would undermine the audience's confidence in its statesmen. The French- language and German- language versions of the film were released in Europe while several versions of the film were released in the United States to mixed reception with each re-release.

The movie is a sequel to Lang's silent film\" Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\"( 1922) and features many cast and crew members from Lang's previous films. The film features Rudolf Klein- Rogge as Dr. Mabuse who is in an insane asylum where he is found frantically writing his crime plans. When Mabuse's criminal plans begin to be implemented, Inspector Lohmann( played by Otto Wernicke) tries to find the solution with clues from gangster Thomas Kent( Gustav Diessl), the institutionalized Hofmeister( Karl Meixner) and Professor Baum( Oscar Beregi Sr.) who becomes obsessed with Dr. Mabuse. \" The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\" was based on elements of author Norbert Jacques' unfinished novel\" Mabuse's Colony\". It was Lang's second sound film for Nero- Film and was his final collaboration with his wife and screenwriter Thea von Harbou. To promote the film to a foreign market, a French- language version of the film was made by Lang with the same sets but different actors with the title\" Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse\". According to Siegfried Kracauer, Lang deliberately intended the film to suggest the Mabuse- like qualities of Adolf Hitler, who was on his rise to become Chancellor of Germany while the film was being written. When Hitler came to power, Joseph Goebbels became Minister of Propaganda and banned the film in Germany, suggesting that the film would undermine the audience's confidence in its statesmen. The French- language and German- language versions of the film were released in Europe while several versions of the film were released in the United States to mixed reception with each re-release.

He went on to serve as the sixth prime minister of Canada, sworn into office on May 1, 1896, seven days after parliament had been dissolved. He lost the June 23 election and resigned on July 8, 1896. His 69-day term as prime minister is currently the shortest in Canadian history. Tupper was born in Amherst, Nova Scotia to the Rev. Charles Tupper and Miriam Lockhart. He was educated at Horton Academy, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, graduating MD in 1843. By the age of 22 he had handled 116 obstetric cases. He practiced medicine periodically throughout his political career (and served as the first president of the Canadian Medical Association). He entered Nova Scotian politics in 1855 as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of James William Johnston. During Johnston's tenure as premier of Nova Scotia in 1857\u201359 and 1863\u201364, Tupper served as provincial secretary. Tupper replaced Johnston as premier in 1864. As premier, he established public education in Nova Scotia and expanded Nova Scotia's railway network in order to promote industry. By 1860, Tupper supported a union of all the colonies of British North America. Believing that immediate union of all the colonies was impossible, in 1864, he proposed a Maritime Union. However, representatives of the Province of Canada asked to be allowed to attend the meeting in Charlottetown scheduled to discuss Maritime Union in order to present a proposal for a wider union, and the Charlottetown Conference thus became the first of the three conferences that secured Canadian Confederation. Tupper also represented Nova Scotia at the other two conferences, the Quebec Conference (1864) and the London Conference of 1866. In Nova Scotia, Tupper organized a Confederation Party to combat the activities of the Anti-Confederation Party organized by Joseph Howe and successfully led Nova Scotia into Confederation. Following the passage of the British North America Act in 1867, Tupper resigned as premier of Nova Scotia and began a career in federal politics. He held multiple cabinet positions under Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, including President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada (1870\u201372), Minister of Inland Revenue (1872\u201373), Minister of Customs (1873\u201374), Minister of Public Works (1878\u201379), and Minister of Railways and Canals (1879\u201384). Initially groomed as Macdonald's successor, Tupper had a falling out with Macdonald, and by the early 1880s, he asked Macdonald to appoint him as Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Tupper took up his post in London in 1883, and would remain High Commissioner until 1895, although in 1887\u201388, he served as Minister of Finance without relinquishing the High Commissionership. In 1895, the government of Sir Mackenzie Bowell floundered over the Manitoba Schools Question; as a result, several leading members of the Conservative Party of Canada demanded the return of Tupper to serve as prime minister. Tupper accepted this invitation and returned to Canada, becoming prime minister in May 1896. An election was called, just before he was sworn in as prime minister, which his party lost to Wilfrid Laurier and the Liberals. Tupper served as Leader of the Opposition from July 1896 until 1900, at which point he returned to London, England, where he lived until his death in 1915 and was laid to rest back in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.

John was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent. The war between Henry II and his eldest sons ended with the deaths of Henry the Young King and Geoffrey. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against the royal administrators of his brother, King Richard, whilst Richard was participating in the Third Crusade, but he was proclaimed king after Richard died in 1199. He came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200. When war with France broke out again in 1202, John achieved early victories, but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman, Breton, and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204. He spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. His judicial reforms had a lasting effect on the English common law system, as well as providing an additional source of revenue. An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John's excommunication in 1209, a dispute he finally settled in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed due to the French victory over John's allies at the battle of Bouvines.

Civil war broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by Louis VIII of France. It soon descended into a stalemate. John died of dysentery contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216; supporters of his son Henry III went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons the following year.

Poitier also received critical acclaim for\" A Raisin in the Sun\"( 1961) and\" A Patch of Blue\"( 1965).

Elizabeth's first marriage was to a minor supporter of the House of Lancaster, Sir John Grey of Groby. He died at the Second Battle of St Albans, leaving Elizabeth a widowed mother of two sons. Her second marriage to Edward IV was a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of the day, thanks to Elizabeth's great beauty and lack of great estates. Edward was the first king of England since the Norman Conquest to marry one of his subjects, and Elizabeth was the first such consort to be crowned queen. Her marriage greatly enriched her siblings and children, but their advancement incurred the hostility of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick,' The Kingmaker', and his various alliances with the most senior figures in the increasingly divided royal family. This hostility turned into open discord between King Edward and Warwick, leading to a battle of wills that finally resulted in Warwick switching allegiance to the Lancastrian cause, and to the execution of Elizabeth's father Richard Woodville in 1469. After the death of her husband in 1483, Elizabeth remained politically influential even after her son, briefly proclaimed King Edward V of England, was deposed by her brother- in- law, Richard III. Edward and his younger brother Richard both disappeared soon afterward, and are presumed to have been murdered. Elizabeth subsequently played an important role in securing the accession of Henry VII in 1485. Henry married her daughter Elizabeth of York, ended the Wars of the Roses, and established the Tudor dynasty. Through her daughter, Elizabeth was a grandmother of the future Henry VIII. Elizabeth was forced to yield pre-eminence to Henry VII's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort; her influence on events in these years, and her eventual departure from court into retirement, remains obscure.\nThought 3: Based on the information provided, Elizabeth Woodville, the mother of Catherine of York, was of English origin. Her family was of middle rank in the English social hierarchy, and she was a subject of England. Therefore, Catherine of York's mother is from England. \n\nAction 3: Finish[England]"}

A biopic based on his life, \"Good Vibrations\", came out in 2013, starring Richard Dormer as Hooley, as well as Dylan Moran and Jodie Whittaker. In October 2012 Hooley was verbally abused and assaulted by two men while out walking his dog in east Belfast.

He was the fourth son of John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet and his wife Margaret Sackville, Baroness Clifford and inherited the title on the death in 1684 of his elder brother Richard Tufton, 5th Earl of Thanet. Through his maternal grandmother, he was heir to the Barony de Clifford and to vast estates in Cumberland and Westmorland. He served as hereditary High Sheriff of Westmorland from 1684 to 1729. He gained the rank of Captain in the service of the Troop of Horse. He held the office of Member of Parliament (M.P.) for Appleby between 1668 and 1679. He succeeded to the title of 6th Earl of the Isle of Thanet, co. Kent [E., 1628] on 27 April 1680. He gained the rank of Colonel in 1685 in the service of the Regiment of Horse (5th Horse). He held the office of Lord-Lieutenant of Westmorland between 1685 and 1687. He held the office of Lord-Lieutenant of Cumberland between 1685 and 1687. He succeeded to the title of 18th Lord Clifford [E., 1299] on 12 December 1691, resolved by the House of Lords. He was invested as a Privy Counsellor (P.C.) from 1703 to 1707 and 1711 to 1714. He held the office of Lord-Lieutenant of Cumberland between 1712 and 1714. On 14 August 1684, he married Lady Catharine Cavendish (d. 1712), daughter of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle. They had eight children, five of whom reached adulthood:\nIn 1703, he was sworn a Privy Counsellor. A country gentleman and a Tory, he was noted by Swift for his \"piety and charity.\" On his death, his title passed to his nephew Sackville Tufton, 7th Earl of Thanet, son of his younger brother Sackville. The barony of Clifford again fell into abeyance until 1734.\nThought 2: Based on the information provided, Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, inherited the title on the death of his elder brother, Richard Tufton, 5th Earl of Thanet, in 1684.

He was the eldest son of Nicholas Tufton, 1st Earl of Thanet and Lady Frances Cecil granddaughter of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. On 21 April 1629, he married Lady Margaret Sackville( 1614 \u2013 1676), daughter of Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset and Lady Anne Clifford. They had eleven children: Thanet was a staunch Cavalier, and in 1642 led a regiment to try to raise a rebellion in Sussex in support of Sir William Brockman in Kent. However, Brockman's revolt quickly collapsed and the Earl was forced to surrender. He suffered considerably from confiscations and sequestrations of his large estates during the English Civil War. Among his properties was Bodiam Castle, purchased from the Levett family in 1639, which Thanet sold for \u00a3 6,000 in 1644. Curiously, he was succeeded as Earl of Thanet by four of his sons in succession, the first three having no issue.\nThought 3: Based on the information provided, John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet, died on 7 May 1664. This means that Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, inherited the title on the death of his father, John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet, in 1664."}

Kutter was awarded two golden medals at the Venice Biennale. Already at age 12, Kutter manufactured his first refracting telescope from lenses taken from a toy cinematograph. Later he became known to Anton Staus (1872-1955) who introduced him to the theory of 's \"Brachy\" telescopes. He invented the Schiefspiegler telescope which is a modified Cassegrain reflector featuring superb optical definition due to an off-axis secondary mirror. An obituary was published by Roger W. Sinnott in \"Sky & Telescope\".\nThought 3: The director of the film \"The Song of Kaprun\" was Anton Kutter, who was born in Biberach an der Ri\u00df, Germany."}

For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\nThought 3: The place of birth of the director of the film \"Mallrats\" is Jersey City, New Jersey, United States. Kevin Smith, the director, was born there."}

He directed and wrote over films between 1931 and 1951 even composing the musical scores for several. He was a pioneer of Variety Theatre, and one of the few tango lyrical writers that has reached timeless classical success. When he was a teenager, he began his journalist job in the Magacine Fray Mochoy, and in the newspapers Cr\u00edtica y \u00daltima Hora. His first play, \"Teatro breve\" is from 1919 with the collaboration of Ivo Pelay. He wrote 180 more. In 1922 the most famous, \"El bailar\u00edn del cabaret\", was staged with the C\u00e9sar Ratti's company, where Corsini triunf\u00f3 (had a success) with \"Patotero sentimental\". In 1923 he travelled to Europe with Luis Bay\u00f3n Herrera. In Paris, where he acted on several plays, he met Carlos Gardel and the idea of filmmaking was born. He wrote the plot and songs for \"Luces de Buenos Aires\", directed by the Chilean Adelqui Millar. It starred Gloria Guzm\u00e1n, Sof\u00eda Boz\u00e1n, Pedro Quartucci and the Julio De Caro musical group.

With that film company, released in February 1935, \"Noches de Buenos Aires\", written and directed by Romero, his cinema career began. The film starred Tita Merello, Irma C\u00f3rdoba, Enrique Serrano and Fernando Ochoa. He filmed very quickly, he only wanted to finish and achieve a good result.

The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism, racism, war and prison, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, \"Reign in Blood\" (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.

Despite his short lifetime, Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre, including more than 600 secular vocal works (mainly lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music and a large body of piano and chamber music. His major works include the Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667 (\"Trout Quintet\"), the Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D. 759 (\"Unfinished Symphony\"), the \u201dGreat\u201d Symphony No. 9 in C major, D. 944, the three last piano sonatas (D. 958\u2013960), the opera \"Fierrabras\" (D. 796), the incidental music to the play \"Rosamunde\" (D. 797), and the song cycles \"Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin\" (D. 795) and \"Winterreise\" (D. 911). Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna, Schubert's uncommon gifts for music were evident from an early age. His father gave him his first violin lessons and his older brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813, and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher; despite this, he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically. In 1821, Schubert was granted admission to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever, but believed by some historians to be syphilis. Appreciation of Schubert's music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased significantly in the decades following his death.

Despite his short lifetime, Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre, including more than 600 secular vocal works (mainly lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music and a large body of piano and chamber music. His major works include the Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667 (\"Trout Quintet\"), the Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D. 759 (\"Unfinished Symphony\"), the \u201dGreat\u201d Symphony No. 9 in C major, D. 944, the three last piano sonatas (D. 958\u2013960), the opera \"Fierrabras\" (D. 796), the incidental music to the play \"Rosamunde\" (D. 797), and the song cycles \"Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin\" (D. 795) and \"Winterreise\" (D. 911). Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna, Schubert's uncommon gifts for music were evident from an early age. His father gave him his first violin lessons and his older brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813, and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher; despite this, he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically. In 1821, Schubert was granted admission to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever, but believed by some historians to be syphilis.

He was born in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey), to Cappadocian Greek parents. After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors' studio introduced \"Method Acting\" under the direction of Lee Strasberg. Kazan acted in a few films, including \"City for Conquest\" (1940). Noted for drawing out the best dramatic performances from his actors, he directed 21 actors to Oscar nominations, resulting in nine wins. He directed a string of successful films, including \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), \"On the Waterfront\" (1954), and \"East of Eden\" (1955). During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director, three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes. He also received an Honorary Oscar. His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by \"Pinky\", one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed \"On the Waterfront\", a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. \" A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\", which introduced James Dean to movie audiences. A turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, along with the work of playwright Clifford Odets. The two men had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his act by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong. \" Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event. Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects.

He was born in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey), to Cappadocian Greek parents. After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors' studio introduced \"Method Acting\" under the direction of Lee Strasberg. Kazan acted in a few films, including \"City for Conquest\" (1940). Noted for drawing out the best dramatic performances from his actors, he directed 21 actors to Oscar nominations, resulting in nine wins. He directed a string of successful films, including \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), \"On the Waterfront\" (1954), and \"East of Eden\" (1955). During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director, three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes. He also received an Honorary Oscar. His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by \"Pinky\", one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed \"On the Waterfront\", a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. \" A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\", which introduced James Dean to movie audiences. A turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, along with the work of playwright Clifford Odets. The two men had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his act by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong. \" Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy.

John Singleton was born on July 2, 1957. \n\nThought 6: Now that I have the birth year of John Singleton, I can compare it with the birth year of the director of \"Mr. Doodle Kicks Off\" to determine which film has the director who is younger. I already know that Leslie Goodwins was born on 17 September 1899. \n\nAction 6: Compare the birth years of John Singleton (1957) and Leslie Goodwins (1899) to determine which film has the director who is younger. \n\nThought 6 (Conclusion): John Singleton, the director of \"Boyz N The Hood (film)\", was born in 1957, which is later than Leslie Goodwins, the director of \"Mr. Doodle Kicks Off\", who was born in 1899. Therefore, \"Boyz N The Hood (film)\" has the director who is younger. \n\nAction 6 (Conclusion): \"Boyz N The Hood (film)\" has the director who is younger.\nObservation 6: \" Boyz- n- the- Hood\" is the debut single by Eazy- E as a part of N.W.A. The song is the lead single from\" N.W.A. and the Posse\". The song samples\" I'm a Ho\" by Whodini and vocal samples from,\" Hold It, Now Hit It\" by Beastie Boys as well as\" Mr. Big Stuff\" by Jean Knight and, near the end, the opening of\" I'll Take You There\" by The Staple Singers. It was remixed and featured on Eazy's debut album\" Eazy- Duz- It\", which was released in 1988. It was remixed again and was featured on Eazy- E's third album,\" It's On( Dr. Dre) 187 Killa\"( 1993) under the name\" Boyz N Tha Hood( G- Mix)\". In 2015,\" Boyz- n- the- Hood\" debuted at number 50 on the\" Billboard\" Hot 100 on the issue dated September 5, 2015, as a result of the releases of the\" Straight Outta Compton\" film and Dr. Dre's\" Compton\"; it was the third- highest debut on the chart that week, behind\" Straight Outta Compton\", another song from the album and the N.W.A era, and\" Hit the Quan\". Like the LP,\" Straight Outta Compton\", the song never charted in the 1980s, largely due to\" Billboard\" charting regulations and lack of airplay, as N.W.A was banned from many radio stations.\nThought 7: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the information provided.

At the instigation of his grandmother, Empress Dowager L\u00fc, Empress Zhang had Emperor Houshao's mother put to death. Very little about Emperor Houshao's life and personality is known.

In 188 BC, his father Emperor Hui died, and his brother Liu Gong succeeded to the throne as Emperor Qianshao. In 187 BC, he was made the Marquess of Xiangcheng. In 186 BC, after his brother Liu Buyi (\u5289\u4e0d\u7591), the Prince of Hengshan, died, he was made the Prince of Hengshan, and his name was changed to Liu Yi, likely because it was considered inappropriate to have one's name (or one's male ancestors' names) share characters with one's titles. Some time during or before 184 BC, Emperor Qianshao discovered that he was not, in fact, now-Empress Dowager Zhang's son and that his mother, like Prince Hong's mother, had been put to death. Emperor Qianshao made the mistake of publicly making the remark that when he grew up, Empress Dowager Zhang would pay for this.

The officials of the imperial government, led by Chen Ping and Zhou Bo, however, formed a conspiracy against the L\u00fc clan, and they were successful in surprising the L\u00fc clan and slaughtering them.

Emperor Houshao, considered to be a mere puppet of Grand Empress Dowager L\u00fc, is often omitted from the official list of emperors of the Han Dynasty.\nThought 2: Based on the information provided, Emperor Houshao of Han's father, Emperor Hui, died in 188 BC.", "predicted_answer": "Question: When did Emperor Houshao Of Han's father die?\nThought 1: I need to search Emperor Houshao Of Han to find information about his father and when he died.\nAction 1: Search[Emperor Houshao Of Han]\nObservation 1: Emperor Houshao of Han (? \u2013 14 November 180 BC), personal name Liu Hong, was the fourth emperor of the Han dynasty in China. He was a son of Emperor Hui, likely by a concubine\u2014although there is some controversy on the subject\u2014and adopted by Emperor Hui's wife, Empress Zhang Yan. At the instigation of his grandmother, Empress Dowager L\u00fc, Empress Zhang had Emperor Houshao's mother put to death. Very little about Emperor Houshao's life and personality is known. There are only a few major important events in his life that are documented (which does not even include the year of his birth). In 188 BC, his father Emperor Hui died, and his brother Liu Gong succeeded to the throne as Emperor Qianshao. In 187 BC, he was made the Marquess of Xiangcheng. In 186 BC, after his brother Liu Buyi (\u5289\u4e0d\u7591), the Prince of Hengshan, died, he was made the Prince of Hengshan, and his name was changed to Liu Yi, likely because it was considered inappropriate to have one's name (or one's male ancestors' names) share characters with one's titles. Some time during or before 184 BC, Emperor Qianshao discovered that he was not, in fact, now-Empress Dowager Zhang's son and that his mother, like Prince Hong's mother, had been put to death. Emperor Qianshao made the mistake of publicly making the remark that when he grew up, Empress Dowager Zhang would pay for this. Grand Empress Dowager L\u00fc, once she heard of this, had Emperor Qianshao secretly imprisoned within the palace and publicly announced that he was severely ill and unable to receive anyone. After some time, Grand Empress Dowager L\u00fc told the officials that he continued to be ill and incapable of governing, and that he had also suffered a psychosis. She proposed that he be deposed and replaced. The officials complied with her wishes, and he was deposed and put to death. Prince Hong then succeeded his brother to the throne as Emperor Houshao and in effect as Grand Empress Dowager L\u00fc's puppet. Because Grand Empress Dowager L\u00fc was actually the ruling figure, one thing that is normally done when a new emperor succeeds to the throne\u2014the resetting of the calendar year to one\u2014was not done; rather, the calendar continued from the start of Emperor Qianshao's reign. In the autumn of 180 BC, Grand Empress Dowager L\u00fc died of an illness. Emperor Houshao, however, still had few actual powers, because power was still largely controlled by the L\u00fc clan. Indeed, the grand empress dowager's will required him to marry the daughter of her nephew L\u00fc Lu (\u5442\u7984) and make her empress. The officials of the imperial government, led by Chen Ping and Zhou Bo, however, formed a conspiracy against the L\u00fc clan, and they were successful in surprising the L\u00fc clan and slaughtering them. Afterwards, the conspirators met and made the assertion that none of the sons of Emperor Hui was actually his. Admitting that they were concerned that these imperial children, when they grew up, would take vengeance on the officials, the conspirators resolved to find a replacement emperor. After a period of disagreement, they settled on Emperor Houshao's uncle, Prince Liu Heng of Dai. Prince Heng soon arrived in the capital Xi'an and was declared emperor, and Emperor Houshao was deposed. Initially, one of the officials involved in the conspiracy, Emperor Houshao's cousin, Liu Xingju, the Marquess of Dongmou, merely expelled Emperor Houshao from the palace and had him stay at the Ministry of Palace Supplies. Some of the imperial guard still wished to resist the coup d'etat but were eventually persuaded by the officials to desist. Some time later that year, Emperor Houshao was executed. Historians are of the view that his wife, Empress L\u00fc, was also executed, but there is no explicit evidence to support this view. Emperor Houshao, considered to be a mere puppet of Grand Empress Dowager L\u00fc, is often omitted from the official list of emperors of the Han Dynasty.\nThought 2: Based on the information provided, Emperor Houshao of Han's father, Emperor Hui, died in 188 BC."}

He was born in Kristiania as a son of Ludvig Monsen (1854\u20131942) and Josefine Aurora Marcelie Dehn (1852\u20131942). Monsen edited the newspaper \"Demokraten\" from 1913 to 1916 and was a member of Hamar city council from 1907 to 1945, serving as mayor in 1916\u20131919. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from the Market towns of Hedmark and Oppland counties in 1922, and was re-elected on six occasions. He represented the Labour Party, except for the term 1925\u20131927 when he represented the Communist Party. During his last term, from December 10, 1945 to January 10, 1949, he was the President of the Storting. Already before the 1945 election, when the old Parliament was convened, Monsen was installed in the Presidium as the Labour Party dropped their former member of the presidium Magnus Nilssen. Monsen headed the Ministry of Defence during the short-lived Hornsrud's Cabinet in 1928 and then during Nygaardsvold's Cabinet. Unsusually for a Minister of Defence, Monsen was an antimilitarist and wrote three anti-militarist pamphlets (\"Sannheten om milit\u00e6rvesenetAvv\u00e6bning eller militarisme\" and \"Milit\u00e6rt vanvidd eller civil fornuft\").\nThought 3: Based on the information provided, Fredrik Monsen, the father of Randi Monsen, died on 31 January 1954.

He became the pretender to the former thrones, Head of the House of Habsburg- Lorraine, and Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1922, upon the death of his father. He resigned as Sovereign of the Golden Fleece in 2000 and as head of the Imperial House in 2007. The eldest son of Charles I and IV, the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, and his wife, Zita of Bourbon- Parma, Otto was born as third in line to the thrones, as Archduke Otto of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary, Bohemia, and Croatia. With his father's accession to the thrones in 1916, he was likely to become emperor and king. As his father never abdicated, Otto was considered by himself, his family and Austro- Hungarian legitimists to be the rightful emperor- king from 1922. Otto was active on the Austrian and European political stage from the 1930s, both by promoting the cause of Habsburg restoration and as an early proponent of European integration\u2014being thoroughly disgusted with nationalism\u2014and a fierce opponent of Nazism and communism. He has been described as one of the leaders of the Austrian Resistance. After the 1938\" Anschluss\", where monarchists were severely persecuted in Austria and sentenced to death by the Nazis, Otto fled Europe to the United States. Otto von Habsburg was Vice President( 1957 \u2013 1973) and President( 1973 \u2013 2004) of the International Paneuropean Union, and served as a Member of the European Parliament for the Christian Social Union of Bavaria( CSU) from 1979 to 1999. As a newly elected Member of the European Parliament in 1979, Otto had an empty chair set up for the countries on the other side of the Iron Curtain in the European Parliament, and took a strong interest in the countries behind the Iron Curtain. Otto von Habsburg played a notable role in the revolutions of 1989, as a co-initiator of the Pan- European Picnic. Later he was a strong supporter of the EU membership of central and eastern European countries. A noted intellectual, he published several books on historical and political affairs. Otto has been described as one of the\" architects of the European idea and of European integration\" together with Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, and Alcide De Gasperi. Otto was exiled in 1919 and grew up mostly in Spain. His devout Catholic mother raised him according to the old curriculum of Austria- Hungary, preparing him to become a Catholic monarch.

In his early youth he served the god Elagabalus as a priest in Emesa, the hometown of his mother's family. As a private citizen, he was probably named Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus. Upon becoming emperor he took the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus. He was called Elagabalus only after his death. In 217, the emperor Caracalla was assassinated and replaced by his Praetorian prefect, Marcus Opellius Macrinus. Caracalla's maternal aunt, Julia Maesa, successfully instigated a revolt among the Third Legion to have her eldest grandson (and Caracalla's cousin), Elagabalus, declared emperor in his place. Macrinus was defeated on 8 June 218 at the Battle of Antioch. Elagabalus, barely 14 years old, became emperor, initiating a reign remembered mainly for sex scandals and religious controversy. Later historians suggest Elagabalus showed a disregard for Roman religious traditions and sexual taboos. He replaced the traditional head of the Roman pantheon, Jupiter, with the deity Elagabalus, of whom he had been high priest. He forced leading members of Rome's government to participate in religious rites celebrating this deity, over which he personally presided. Elagabalus was supposedly \"married\" as many as five times, and lavished favours on male courtiers popularly thought to have been his lovers. He was also reported to have prostituted himself in the imperial palace. His behavior estranged the Praetorian Guard, the Senate, and the common people alike. Amidst growing opposition, Elagabalus, just 18 years old, was assassinated and replaced by his cousin Severus Alexander on 11 March 222, who ruled for 13 years before his own assassination, which marked the epoch event for the Crisis of the Third Century. The assassination plot against Elagabalus was devised by his grandmother, Julia Maesa, and carried out by disaffected members of the Praetorian Guard. Elagabalus developed a reputation among his contemporaries for extreme eccentricity, decadence, and zealotry. This tradition has persisted, and with writers of the early modern age he suffers one of the worst reputations among Roman emperors. Edward Gibbon, for example, wrote that Elagabalus \"abandoned himself to the grossest pleasures and ungoverned fury\". According to Barthold Georg Niebuhr, \"The name Elagabalus is branded in history above all others\" because of his \"unspeakably disgusting life\".

His leadership undertook sweeping progressive reforms, which modernized Turkey into a secular, industrial nation. Ideologically a secularist and nationalist, his policies and theories became known as Kemalism. Atat\u00fcrk came to prominence for his role in securing the Ottoman Turkish victory at the Battle of Gallipoli (1915) during World War I. Following the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, he led the Turkish National Movement, which resisted the mainland Turkey's partition among the victorious Allied powers. Establishing a provisional government in the present-day Turkish capital Ankara, he defeated the forces sent by the Allies, thus emerging victorious from what was later referred to as the Turkish War of Independence. He subsequently proceeded to abolish the decrepit Ottoman Empire and proclaimed the foundation of the Turkish Republic in its place. As the president of the newly formed Turkish Republic, Atat\u00fcrk initiated a rigorous program of political, economic, and cultural reforms with the ultimate aim of building a modern, progressive, and secular nation-state. He made primary education free and compulsory, opening thousands of new schools all over the country. He also introduced the Latin-based Turkish alphabet, replacing the old Ottoman Turkish alphabet. Turkish women received equal civil and political rights during Atat\u00fcrk's presidency ahead of many Western countries. In particular, women were given voting rights in local elections by Act no. 1580 on 3 April 1930 and a few years later, in 1934, full universal suffrage, earlier than most other countries in the world. His government carried out a policy of Turkicisation trying to create a homogeneous and unified nation. Under Atat\u00fcrk, non-Turkish minorities were pressured to speak Turkish in public, non-Turkish toponyms and last names of minorities had to be changed to Turkish renditions. The Turkish Parliament granted him the surname Atat\u00fcrk in 1934, which means \"Father of the Turks\", in recognition of the role he played in building the modern Turkish Republic. He died on 10 November 1938 at the age of 57 in Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace; he was succeeded as President by his long-time Prime Minister \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc and was honored with a state funeral. His iconic mausoleum, built and opened in 1953, is surrounded by a park called the Peace Park in honor of his famous expression \"Peace at Home, Peace in the World\". In 1981, the centennial of Atat\u00fcrk's birth, his memory was honoured by the UN and UNESCO, which declared it \"The Atat\u00fcrk Year in the World\" and adopted the Resolution on the Atat\u00fcrk Centennial, describing him as \"the leader of the first struggle given against colonialism and imperialism\" and a \"remarkable promoter of the sense of understanding between peoples and durable peace between the nations of the world and that he worked all his life for the development of harmony and cooperation between peoples without distinction\". Atat\u00fcrk is commemorated by many memorials throughout Turkey and numerous countries all over the world, where place names are named in honor of him.

His leadership undertook sweeping progressive reforms, which modernized Turkey into a secular, industrial nation. Ideologically a secularist and nationalist, his policies and theories became known as Kemalism. Atat\u00fcrk came to prominence for his role in securing the Ottoman Turkish victory at the Battle of Gallipoli (1915) during World War I. Following the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, he led the Turkish National Movement, which resisted the mainland Turkey's partition among the victorious Allied powers. Establishing a provisional government in the present-day Turkish capital Ankara, he defeated the forces sent by the Allies, thus emerging victorious from what was later referred to as the Turkish War of Independence. He subsequently proceeded to abolish the decrepit Ottoman Empire and proclaimed the foundation of the Turkish Republic in its place. As the president of the newly formed Turkish Republic, Atat\u00fcrk initiated a rigorous program of political, economic, and cultural reforms with the ultimate aim of building a modern, progressive, and secular nation-state. He made primary education free and compulsory, opening thousands of new schools all over the country. He also introduced the Latin-based Turkish alphabet, replacing the old Ottoman Turkish alphabet. Turkish women received equal civil and political rights during Atat\u00fcrk's presidency ahead of many Western countries. In particular, women were given voting rights in local elections by Act no. 1580 on 3 April 1930 and a few years later, in 1934, full universal suffrage, earlier than most other countries in the world. His government carried out a policy of Turkicisation trying to create a homogeneous and unified nation. Under Atat\u00fcrk, non-Turkish minorities were pressured to speak Turkish in public, non-Turkish toponyms and last names of minorities had to be changed to Turkish renditions. The Turkish Parliament granted him the surname Atat\u00fcrk in 1934, which means \"Father of the Turks\", in recognition of the role he played in building the modern Turkish Republic.
