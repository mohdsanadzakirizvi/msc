Identical in standard except for coat and colour differences, in some standards they are considered varieties of the same breed, much like Belgian Shepherd Dogs.\nThought 2: The Griffon Bruxellois is described as a toy dog breed. I will now search for the size of the English Mastiff to compare.\n\nAction 2: Search[English Mastiff size]\nObservation 2: The English Mastiff is a breed of extremely large dog (often known simply as the Mastiff) perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century. Distinguishable by enormous size, massive head, and a limited range of colours, but always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity. Throughout its history, the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as Mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as \"Mastiffs\".\nThought 3: Based on the observations, the Griffon Bruxellois is described as a toy dog breed, which implies it is significantly smaller than the English Mastiff, which is described as an extremely large dog breed. Therefore, the English Mastiff is bigger than the Griffon Bruxellois."}

Along with its sister titles, \"The Haunt of Fear\" and \"The Vault of Horror\", \"Tales from the Crypt\" was popular, but in the late 1940s and early 1950s comic books came under attack from parents, clergymen, schoolteachers and others who believed the books contributed to illiteracy and juvenile delinquency. In April and June 1954, highly publicized Congressional subcommittee hearings on the effects of comic books upon children left the industry shaken. With the subsequent imposition of a highly restrictive Comics Code, EC Comics publisher Bill Gaines cancelled \"Tales from the Crypt\" and its two companion horror titles, along with the company's remaining crime and science fiction series in September 1954. All EC titles have been reprinted at various times since their demise, and stories from the horror series have been adapted for television and film.\nThought 2: The search result did not provide information about specific actors from Tales from the Crypt or any awards they won.

December 26, 1985) was an American primatologist and conservationist known for undertaking an extensive study of mountain gorilla groups over a period of 18 years. She studied them daily in the mountain forests of Rwanda, initially encouraged to work there by anthropologist Louis Leakey. Her 1983 book, \"Gorillas in the Mist\", combines her scientific study of the gorillas at Karisoke Research Center with her own personal story. It was adapted into a 1988 film of the same name. Fossey was brutally murdered in her cabin at a remote camp in Rwanda in December 1985.\nThought 5: The search finally provided the name of the individual chosen by Louis Leakey for studying hominids in their natural environments, along with Jane Goodall.
