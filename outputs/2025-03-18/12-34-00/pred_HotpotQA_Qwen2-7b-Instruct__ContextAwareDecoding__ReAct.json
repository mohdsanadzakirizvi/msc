The sedimentary deposit of a turbidity current is called a turbidite.\nThought 3: The searches for Sugar Ray and Against the Current in the context of 1990s mainstream fame did not yield the correct information. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the search terms. I should try searching for Against the Current specifically without mentioning the 1990s to get more relevant results.\n\nAction 3: Search[Against the Current mainstream fame]\nObservation 3: A turbidity current is most typically an underwater current of usually rapidly moving, sediment-laden water moving down a slope. Turbidity currents can also occur in other fluids besides water. In the most typical case of oceanic turbidity currents, sediment laden waters situated over sloping ground will flow down-hill because they have a higher density than the adjacent waters. The driving force behind a turbidity current is gravity acting on the high density of the sediments temporarily suspended within a fluid. These semi-suspended solids make the average density of the sediment bearing water greater than that of the surrounding, undisturbed water. As such currents flow, they often have a \"snow-balling-effect\", as they stir up the ground over which they flow, and gather even more sedimentary particles in their current. Their passage leaves the ground over which they flow scoured and eroded. Once an oceanic turbidity current reaches the calmer waters of the flatter area of the abyssal plain (main oceanic floor), the particles borne by the current settle out of the water column. The sedimentary deposit of a turbidity current is called a turbidite.\nThought 4: There seems to be a mix-up in the search results. The text provided is about turbidity currents, not Against the Current, the American rock band. I should try refining the search to ensure it's about the band's mainstream fame.\n\nAction 4: Search[Against the Current band mainstream success]\nObservation 4: Against Their Will is an American rock/heavy metal band from North Carolina.\nThought 5: The search result for Against Their Will indicates that I might have misspelled the band's name in the previous search. I should correct the spelling and try searching again to find information about mainstream success for Against The Current.\n\nAction 5: Search[Against The Current band mainstream success]\nObservation 5: Against Their Will is an American rock/heavy metal band from North Carolina.\nThought 6: There seems to be another mix-up in the search results. The text provided is about Against Their Will, another American rock/heavy metal band from North Carolina, not Against The Current. I should correct the spelling again and ensure the search is about the correct band.\n\nAction 6: Search[Against The Current mainstream success]\nObservation 6: Matrilineal succession is a form of hereditary succession or other inheritance through which the subject's female relatives are traced back in a matrilineal line.\nThought 7: There seems to be another mix-up in the search results.

I should ensure the search is about the correct band one last time.\n\nAction 7: Search[Against The Current mainstream success]\nObservation 7: Matrilineal succession is a form of hereditary succession or other inheritance through which the subject's female relatives are traced back in a matrilineal line."}

He is considered the founder of the largest national school of surgery and \"the father of Russian urology\".\nThought 2: It seems there might be a mix-up in the search results. Sergey Petrovich Fedorov appears to be a historical medical figure, not Vladimir Fedorov's former ice skating partner.

He is considered the founder of the largest national school of surgery and \"the father of Russian urology\".\nThought 4: It seems there was still confusion in the search results, pointing to Sergey Petrovich Fedorov, a historical medical figure, instead of finding information about Vladimir Fedorov's ice skating career. I need to rephrase the search one more time to directly look for his ice skating partner.\n\nAction 4: Search[Vladimir Fedorov ice skating partner name]\nObservation 4: Sergey Petrovich Fedorov (Russian: \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, alternative English spelling Sergey Petrovich Fyodorov) was a Russian surgeon-urologist, professor of the Imperial Military Medical Academy (1903) and the Imperial Court Surgeon (1913). He is considered the founder of the largest national school of surgery and \"the father of Russian urology\".\nThought 5: It appears there has been a misunderstanding throughout the search process, consistently linking Sergey Petrovich Fedorov to medical history rather than Vladimir Fedorov's ice skating career. Given the repeated incorrect results, it seems Vladimir Fedorov does not have a widely documented partner in ice skating, or the search results are not providing the correct information. I will conclude that there is insufficient information available to determine the current job of Vladimir Fedorov's former ice skating partner.\n\nAction 5: Finish[insufficient information]"}
