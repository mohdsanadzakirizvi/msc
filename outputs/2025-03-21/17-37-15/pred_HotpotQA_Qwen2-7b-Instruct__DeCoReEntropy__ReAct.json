He came to prominence in the early 1980s as a member of Dio, and has been a member of Def Leppard since 1992 (replacing Steve Clark). Campbell has also worked with Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, Sweet Savage, Trinity, Riverdogs, and Shadow King.\nThought 3: Thought 3: Based on the observation, Vivian Campbell is a former lead guitarist coming from Dewey Arzuaga Dio and currently a member of Def Leppard. Def Leppard has a two-disc compilation album titled \"Viva! Hysteria\". However, this question asks for a solo album named a two-disc compilation album. Dewey revealed he recorded a two-disc solo album before his death in 2011, but it was never released.\n\nAction 3: Finish[Dewey Arzuaga]"}

In the offseason, the team acquired Reggie Theus from the Orlando Magic. However, the Nets continued to struggle losing eleven consecutive games between December and January. Their movement would continue at midseason as they acquired Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107 from the Portland Trail Blazers, and rookie Terry Mills from the Denver Nuggets. The Nets finished fifth in the Atlantic Division with a 26\u201356 record. Coleman had a stellar rookie season averaging 18.4 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, as he was named Rookie of The Year. Following the season, Theus retired.\nThought 2: Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107 was the Croatian professional basketball player (a shooting guard) that New Jersey Nets acquired during their 1990\u201391 season."}

Action 1: Search[Substorm described in qualitative terms]\nObservation 1: A substorm, sometimes referred to as a magnetospheric substorm or an auroral substorm, is a brief disturbance in the Earth's magnetosphere that causes energy to be released from the \"tail\" of the magnetosphere and injected into the high latitude ionosphere. Visually, a substorm is seen as a sudden brightening and increased movement of auroral arcs. Substorms were first described in qualitative terms by Kristian Birkeland which he called polar elementary storms. Sydney Chapman used the term substorm about 1960 which is now the standard term. The morphology of aurora during of a substorm was first described by Syun-Ichi Akasofu in 1964 using data collected during the International Geophysical Year.\nThought 2: Thought 2: The scientist who first described substorms in qualitative terms is Kristian Birkeland.

Action 2: Search[Kristian Birkeland nominated for seven times]\nObservation 2: Kristian Olaf Bernhard Birkeland (13 December 1867 \u2013 15 June 1917) was a Norwegian scientist. He is best remembered as the person whose theories of atmospheric electric currents elucidated the nature of the aurora borealis. In order to fund his research on the aurorae, he invented the electromagnetic cannon and the Birkeland-Eyde process of fixing nitrogen from the air. Birkeland was nominated for the Nobel Prize seven times.\nThought 3: Thought 3: The scientist who was described in qualitative terms for substorms and was nominated for the Nobel Prize seven times is Kristian Birkeland.\n\nAction 3: Finish[Kristian Birkeland]"}
